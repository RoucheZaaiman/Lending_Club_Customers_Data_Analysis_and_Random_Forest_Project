# Lending_Club_Customers_Data_Analysis_and_Random_Forest_Project

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will attempt to create a model that will help to predict the kind of customers investors should invest in. 

We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and attempt to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. The csv provided has been cleaned of NA values. 

Libraries used in this project are Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn. 

This project was done through Jose Portilla (head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp).
